## Growth Mindset
A growth mindset is believing in yourself. It is having the motivation, energy, and willingness to try something new. 

### Things to rember to maintain growth mindset:
1. :sleeping_bed: Rest. It takes energy. Come back to it later if you can't summon the needed energy.
2. :checker: Remember the goal. This is what drives you.
3. :hammer: Try. Without a try, you have already failed by default. Try, try hard, and then try again.
