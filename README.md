# My Reading Journal
My reading journal for Code Fellows.
## About me
Good day. I am Mr. Bradley Hower, located in Seattle. My background is in mortgages. My goal is to do a career switch - to work at a company where I can be part of building something awesome. Fortunately, the team here at Code Fellows has granted me access to this course, despite it having started July 3rd. I am very motivated and plan to work on this full-time. Tinkering with technology has always been a bit of a hobby of mine. Previously, I learned HTML and CSS. I also studied Python a couple years ago. Currently, I am running the latest version of MX Linux, version 21.3. I am excited to learn some valuable skills and have fun solving problems along the way! Let's build something great.

## Class 102, Entry 1: Growth Mindset 
A growth mindset is believing in yourself. It is having the motivation, energy, and willingness to try something new. 

### Things to rember to maintain a growth mindset:
1. üõå **Rest.** It takes energy. Come back to it later if you can't summon the needed energy.
2. üèÅ **Remember the goal.** This is what drives you.
3. üî® **Try.** Without a try, you have already failed by default. Try, try hard, and then try again.
