## *Class 102, Entry 1: Growth Mindset* ##
A growth mindset is believing in yourself. It is having the motivation, energy, and willingness to try something new. 

### Things to remember to maintain a growth mindset: ###
1. üõå **Rest.** It takes energy. Come back to it later if you can't summon the needed energy.
2. üèÅ **Remember the goal.** This is what drives you.
3. üî® **Try.** Without a try, you have already failed by default. Try, try hard, and then try again.
