# *Course 401 Python, Entry 27: Django Models

**Explain the purpose and basic structure of Django models. How do they help in creating and managing database schema in a Django application?**

Django models are Python objects used to define the structure of data stored. Via these models, associations across data can be had, whether it is one-to-one (OnToOneField), one to many (ForeignKey), or many to many (ManyToManyField). The number of fields of data can be defined.

The different field options are listed here: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/models/fields/#field-options](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/models/fields/#field-options)

Models also consist of metadata and methods.

**Describe the primary features and functionality of the Django Admin interface. How can it be customized to suit the specific needs of a project?**

The admin application allows the user to easily update records within a database. The models used can be customized via import, each when thereafter being registered.

Via a superuser (an admin-type privilege) allows for full access to change a database.
