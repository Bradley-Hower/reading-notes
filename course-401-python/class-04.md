# *Course 401 Python, Entry 4: Object Oriented Programming*

## Objects

Objects are composed of variables and functions in one package. The variables and functions found in objects come from classes.

To assign an object, use the following syntax, `someobject = TheClass()`

After assigning the object, accessing variables can be done via dot notation, `someobject.variable`. Note, these can be assigned to other variables and are not bound.

Similarly, a function can be accessed, `someobject.function()`.

### init()

The `__init__()` is a special function, called upon class initiation and used for assignments.

## Recursive Functions in Python



**What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?**

Objects are itirations of classes. Classes are used to create the objects by utilizing the variables and functions therein.

**Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?**



**What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.**
