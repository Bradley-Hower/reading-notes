## Pain and Suffering

**In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.**

The main challenges are facing new problems, technical and otherwise, that are completely new. Additionally, there is a lot of content, so there will be quite a push. Lots of work, little rest.

## Beginners Guide to Big O

**After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.**

Time complexitiy is basically how much time it takes to run an algorithm. This is highly dependent on the size of the data being processed and the total number of potential iterations. Space complexity is dependent mostly on the data structure of the data being processed and its size. Objects, for example, are much more data hungry than an integer.

## Names and Values in Python

**Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.**

Mutable values can be changed in place. Immutable values can not. Rather, in immutable values, new data is created and then reassinment occurs via rebinding.

## Things I want to know more about

What other languages are there that make the division from mutables and immutables even more clear, which support immutables values more? Ned Batchelder had mentioned there are others in his PyCon talk.
