### Carol Dweck

By setting the right mindset ahead of time, one can be persistant and work past really hard problems. Instead of being set in failure, thinking "not yet" is a better more helpful mindset. This powerful mindset has taken underperforming children to the top of their state. The key to their performance shift was having the right mindset.

### Alain de Botton

Snobbery, rooted in envy, leads to unhappiness. In other words, comparison is the death of happiness. A society that tells you that you can do anything is most closely connected to a society made up of many with low self-esteem. Consequently, failure also feels much more crushing and deserved. And what people fear the most, is negative judgement by others.
