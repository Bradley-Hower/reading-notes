# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

A component is a piece of code, with its methods, events, and properties, which has well-defined uses which can be used and re-used in different areas of the total architecture.

Characteristics of Components:

1. Independent - Functional with little to no dependencies.

2. Not context specific - Can be used among many use cases.

3. Encapsulated - Only shows interfaces, thus allowing code to be proprietary.

4. Replaceable - Interchangeable with other components.

5. Reusability - Can be used and reused in multiple different parts.

6. Extensible - New capabilities being able to be added on.

### Advantages

Ease to implement - Much like a car or bicycle, it's always easier to replace things in parts.

Ease to develop - With pre-defined interfaces, it is much easier to design.

Reduced cost - No need to write code if it has been done before.

Reusable - Just as with cost, code that can be used in multiple areas is a good thing.

Modification of technical complexity - Modularity via parts.

Reliability - If the code worked previously in a similar use case, the bugs for the most part should be worked out.

System maintenance and evolution - Simplifies maintenance and update.

Independent - Parallel programming becomes much easier.

## Introduction to Props, Using Props in React

"Props" is short for properties. These properties are used for transmitting data from one component to another. This flow is uni-directional and read-only.

Props are passed into components via a function argument.
