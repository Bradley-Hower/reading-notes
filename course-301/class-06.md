## Teams

The following questions and answers are in regards to the following article. [https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html)

**To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?**

Psychological safety massively impacts the effectiveness of a team. My experience has been that when people are not allowed to be heard, the moral of the team plummets. When people sense that their viewpoint and ideas don't matter, they naturally checkout and default to the bare-minimum work standard. This sums up what my experiences have been when working in a toxic environment. Ultimately, at one place, I resigned for a new job as soon as I could due to the unhealthy work environment.

**How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?**

This article has taught me the importance of hearing what team members have to say. When people feel that they are truly embraced, that is when they do their best work. It is in this environment that people find purpose in their work and do their best work.

## REST

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

Roy Fielding is a really smart guy. He helped write the first web protocol for sending documents accross the internet, HTTP.

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

The reason being is that the web was not originally designed with the purpose of communicating with so many different machines. It was only designed to communicate with a few other machines at a time. With APIs now becoming more prevelant, machines need to communicate more than ever before.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

REST - Representation State Transfer.

**What does a GET do?**

GET retrieves any specified file.

**What does a POST do?**

POST copies a file from one machine to the other.

**What does PUT do?**

PUT updates the file in another system with a new one.

**What does PATCH do?**

PATCH does a partial update of the file in another system.
