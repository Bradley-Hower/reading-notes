## *Course 102, Demo: Growth Mindset*
A growth mindset is believing in yourself. It is having the motivation, energy, and willingness to try something new. 

### Things to remember to maintain a growth mindset:
1. 🛌 **Rest.** It takes energy. Come back to it later if you can't summon the needed energy.
2. 🏁 **Remember the goal.** This is what drives you.
3. 🔨 **Try.** Without a try, you have already failed by default. Try, try hard, and then try again.
