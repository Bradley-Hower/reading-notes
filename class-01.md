## HTTP - A Poem

The lights come on, the browswer comes up,
But what shall I do today? Yes, what?

I want to go to my favorite website,
but how does my computer know where to go?

My internet service provider has a set DNS server inside,
there it will find, readmymind... .com
This is how it will know where to go.

The name of the site isn't enough, as HTTP uses numbers,
that is where the DNS server works wonders.

It pulls up my site's IP address. And shortly I can see,
my favorite website via transer protocols HTTP and ICP/IP.

TCP/IP is the outer most wrapper,
and inside is the HTTP, looking all dapper.

Once my favorite site's server say "200 OK",
All the beautiful data packets, small chunks, of the website files,
are on their way.

My browser receives them,
ney, it needs them,
to display my favorite site.
